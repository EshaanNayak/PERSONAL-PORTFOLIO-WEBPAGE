##A personal portfolio webpage is a simple and effective way to present information about oneself in a professional and organized manner. The main purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase personal details, skills, education, projects, and experience in one place. It acts as a digital resume that can be easily shared with recruiters, professors, or peers and can be accessed anytime through a web browser.
The portfolio webpage is designed using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage, including sections like Home, Skills, Education, Projects, Experience, and Contact. Each section is clearly separated to make the content easy to read and understand. Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links are arranged in a clean layout so that visitors can quickly find the information they are looking for.
CSS is used to style the webpage and improve its visual appearance. A modern color theme and smooth layout are applied to make the website look attractive and professional. CSS is also used to control spacing, alignment, fonts, and responsiveness, ensuring that the webpage looks good on different screen sizes such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Simple hover effects and transitions are added to make the user experience more interactive without making the design too complex.
JavaScript is used to add basic interactivity to the portfolio. One of its main uses is to highlight the active navigation link while scrolling through different sections of the page. This helps users know which section they are currently viewing. JavaScript also improves the overall smoothness of the webpage by making it feel more dynamic and user-friendly.
The Home section introduces the person with a short greeting, name, and a brief description of interests or roles. The Skills section lists technical skills in a simple tag format for easy readability. The Education section displays academic details in a timeline style to show progression clearly. The Projects section highlights personal or academic projects with short descriptions, giving visitors an idea of practical experience. The Experience section lists internships, roles, or responsibilities held in different activities. The Contact section provides essential contact details such as email, phone number, and location.
This portfolio webpage was developed using Visual Studio Code as the code editor. VS Code made it easier to write, organize, and debug code with features like syntax highlighting and live preview. Creating this portfolio helped improve understanding of frontend development concepts and encouraged better presentation of personal achievements. Overall, this portfolio webpage serves as a simple, professional, and useful platform to represent skills and experiences online.
